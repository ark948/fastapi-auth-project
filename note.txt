- added templates (in pages app)
- added static (for pages app to serve html)

- required for testing:
> pip install httpx

- adding database (will be used for auth app) (will be updated from sqlalchemy to sqlmodel)
- requires python-dotenv, sqlalchemy, sqlmodel

-> for input (request) and output (response) control --> use schema
-> for creation, deletion, update (crud) actions --> use model

OAuth2 uses form data to send username and password (uses python-multipart)

- adding actual authentication
- fastapi doc is just filled with fake dummy examples and everything in one file
- first, we need to implement password hashing (we will use passlib)
> pip install "passlib[bcrypt]" (bcrypt is the recommended hashing algorithm)
- create a passlib context (this is what will be used to hash and verify passwords)
- python-jose package may also be required
- also pyjwt
- tokens are not kept in database, they only will be verified upon each request


- first password hashing (done)
- then login process (done)
- protecting routes 
- getting current user

remaining: 
a more complete user model with profile
account verification
account recovery (email and password)


# tokenUrl will be the URL that frontend will send username and password...
# to get a token


# get_current_usre -> get_user -> user_crud
# login_for_access -> authenticate_user


(NOTE: DO NOT RETURN HTTPException, RAISE it)

session must come from request (pass along)
